# NotebookLM Guidance: Reusable Inventory RL

## Suggested NotebookLM Items
1.  **Strategy Memo**: How multi-echelon inventory management adapts to high-cadence launch schedules.
2.  **Simulation Narrative**: A walkthrough of the RL agent's decision-making process during a 100-launch burst.
3.  **Benchmark Table**: Comparing traditional inventory buffers to the RL-optimized buffers.

## Suggested Prompt
"Analyze the Raytheon examples provided and explain how Starship's reusability specifically enables a 22% reduction in holding costs. Using the scikit-optimize approach discussed, suggest a multi-phase implementation plan for a Tier 1 aerospace supplier."

## Infographics

### Standard Infographic Prompt
"Create an infographic titled 'Rebirthing Cash: Reusable Inventory'. Show a visual representation of Little's Law and how rapid turnaround times shrink multi-echelon stock piles. Highlight the 22% cost reduction achieved in the Raytheon examples."

### Detailed Infographic Prompt
"Generate a detailed 'Inventory Optimization Architecture' infographic. Diagram the multi-echelon supply chain, the RL agent's input sensors (turnaround time, launch cadence, costs), and the scikit-optimize loop. Include a sensitivity analysis chart showing inventory levels versus launch frequency."

## Gemini Canvas Visual Prompt
"Create a dynamic multi-echelon inventory simulation. Visualize the supply chain nodes as a tiered hierarchy. As the 'Launch Cadence' increases, show the 'Inventory Levels' pulsing and shrinking to represent the RL agent's optimization. Add a 'Rebirth of Cash' animation where minimized inventory turns into a flowing silver stream back into the 'Budget' pool."

## Theme
**The Reusable Flow**: Sleek, administrative grey and industrial brushed-steel silver. Focus on the 'rebirth' of cash through minimized stock-piles.
